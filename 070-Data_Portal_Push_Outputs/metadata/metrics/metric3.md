## Overview
The calculation of carbon content is closely tied to energy content, calculated in metric one. For each type of fuel, our model uses kgCO2e /MMBTU coefficients to convert energy content into carbon content. Calculations can be seen in Table 8. Since each fuel has different carbon contents and different life cycle coefficients, if Hawaii’s portfolio mix changes in the coming years, the ratio of energy content to carbon content will change. The carbon content stated in this metric includes upstream life cycle contributions including production of methane, nitrogen and other greenhouse gas producing compounds quantified according to greenhouse gas CO2e equivalent coefficients.
## Issues and Data Gaps
As metric three uses much of the same data as metric one, the sources of data are almost identical. It uses EIA’s foreign import and consumption data and DBEDT’s consumption data for biofuels. NETL provides life cycle factors for all fuels except biofuels, for which we use the potential study from UHERO. Again, similar to metric one, these calculations are susceptible to the incongruity between EIA’s import and consumption data. Also as was true for Metric one, the differences between life cycle emissions of local biofuels versus imported biofuels is not provided here, and it has the potential to be significant.
